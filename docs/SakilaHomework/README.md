ELINQ allows you to use C# (or your .NET language of choice) to write strongly typed queries. It is capable to represent _**any**_ practical SQL [DML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language).

Sakila is a popular [sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) developed by MySQL. Many institutions build their SQL exams and homeworks on this database (Google for ["Sakila Homework"](https://www.google.com/search?q=Sakila+Homework)).

To demonstrate ELINQ capabilities we took questions from one such [homework](https://github.com/joelsotelods/sakila-db-queries) and implemented them in C# and ELINQ in a strongly typed way. Our goal is to show "pixel-perfect" SQL translation, EF integration, type safety and ease of use (we take the example as is, without trying to improve SQL).

This site is built with a wonderful Try .NET technology. All the examples are interactive, intellisense enabled and runnable with changes you may make. Enjoy!

> All the examples are executed against a real database, created according to provided [instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html). The DbContext is [scaffolded](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/scaffolding) with EF tooling in a separate project [hosted](https://github.com/streamx-co/try.elinq/tree/master/Models) on GitHub.
>
> All queries are executed in a transaction, which is rolled back at the end. Therefore no changes are persisted and each query can be executed multiple times producing same results. In addition we installed a [console logger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/logging) to inspect the executed SQL.
