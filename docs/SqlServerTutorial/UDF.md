# SQL Server User-defined Functions

> The only relevant section in the *Advanced* menu is UDF. Others are [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language), which is not yet supported by ELINQ.

**We suggest to open the corresponding [tutorial page](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-user-defined-functions/) and go over the examples "side by side".**

- [User-defined scalar functions](ScalarUDF.md)
- [Table-valued functions](TableUDF.md)

> **Hint:** *Table-valued functions* let collaborate with DB admins easily, yet keep the responsibility boundaries.
